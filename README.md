#Api-Hack-Capstone

Business Connet provides a rolodex of local locations to find like-minded spaces to collaborate withothers
on the next project, event, or simply a safe space to work creatively.

Motivation
I wanted a business recommendation app that was community driven. Business lists are all created by the users and their nearby locations
